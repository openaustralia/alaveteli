      <h3>About Censor Rules</h3>
      <p>Censor Rules are rules to redact information from incoming and outgoing
         messages.</p>
      <p>Redacting means removing or hiding part of a message so it cannot be
         read: you are effectively removing part of a document from your site.
         Typically you do this to conceal sensitive (usually, that means
         personal) information on the public site.</p>
      <p>These can be powerful, so must be used with caution.</p>
      <p>Censor Rules can be associated with the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Info Requests:</strong> Applies to everything on a single request</li>
        <li><strong>Users:</strong> Applies to all requests made by the associated user</li>
        <li><strong>Public Bodies:</strong> Applies to all requests made to the associated body</li>
        <li><strong>Global:</strong> Applies to <em>everything</em> on the site</li>
      </ul>
